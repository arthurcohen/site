I'm a Software Developer, student, passionate about mobile development. Currently living at Recife, I recently moved from my hometown seeking challenges to surpass.

I'm a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) entusiast, and love to play with back-end development. I've learn a lot about Java and their peculiarities. Nowdays my focus is in [Node](https://nodejs.org/), cause I know that will help me being faster while building any solution and because JavaScript is much more intuitive and clean than Java.
