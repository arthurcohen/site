You got to Arthur Cohen personal page. Here I'll share some thoughts about software development, experiments that I made, tools, frameworks, etc.

Also you'll be able to find more about me at the contacts.txt file :)

Feel free to sail through my directories. Maybe you can find something cool and useful to you. Hope to help you.

And don't forget to look at my projects folder. Support me on Github, and if you have any idea that can save the world, just let me know.
