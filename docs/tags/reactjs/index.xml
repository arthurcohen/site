      <description>Well, this is a very delicated subject to manage.
At March 16 I started to work at a new company, in another city, 400km far from home, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, and, oh boy, at first, it was hard.
There was 2 friends with me living by the next door. They supported me all the times, and we were together whenever possible, respection all the social distance and self-isolation rules.</description>
