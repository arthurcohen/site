I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Developer, student, passionate about mobile development. Currently living at Recife, I recently moved from my hometown seeking challenges to surpass.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Flutter entusiast, and love to play with back-end development. I&amp;rsquo;ve learn a lot about Java and their peculiarities. Nowdays my focus is in Node, cause I know that will help me being faster while building any solution and because JavaScript is much more intuitive and clean than Java.</description>

      <description>Well, this is a very delicated subject to manage.
At March 16 I started to work at a new company, in another city, 400km far from home, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, and, oh boy, at first, it was hard.
There was 2 friends with me living by the next door. They supported me all the times, and we were together whenever possible, respection all the social distance and self-isolation rules.</description>
